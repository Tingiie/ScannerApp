# ScannerApp

This app is the result of an Android Studio workshop from the course MAMN01 at LTH.

It consists of a compass and an accelerometer. The compass shows a rotating needle as well as the degrees.
When the needle is pointed north it causes a short vibration. 
The accelerometer outputs the coordinate values as well as the slope of the phone (Left, Right, Up, Down).




All code is written by myself except for the class CompassActivity.java where I followed 
this tutorial: https://www.wlsdevelop.com/index.php/en/blog?option=com_content&view=article&id=38 
while making some modifications of my own (e.g. the vibration feature).
